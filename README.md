### Pre-requisites

- Allow NSG WinRm Inbound Traffic (HTTPS port 5986) from GitHub Actions Runner VNet/Subnet
- Prep the remote IIS server to accept WinRM IIS management calls.  Detailed instructions and explanations can be found in this article: [PowerShell Remoting over HTTPS with a self-signed SSL certificate]

  This is a sample script that would be run on the target IIS server:

  ```powershell
  $Cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertstoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My -DnsName <<ip-address|fqdn-host-name>>

  Export-Certificate -Cert $Cert -FilePath C:\temp\<<cert-name>>

  Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force

  # Check for HTTP listeners
  dir wsman:\localhost\listener

  # If HTTP Listeners exist, remove them
  Get-ChildItem WSMan:\Localhost\listener | Where -Property Keys -eq "Transport=HTTP" | Remove-Item -Recurse

  # If HTTPs Listeners don't exist, add one
  New-Item -Path WSMan:\LocalHost\Listener -Transport HTTPS -Address * -CertificateThumbPrint $Cert.Thumbprint â€“Force

  # This allows old WinRm hosts to use port 443
  Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\EnableCompatibilityHttpsListener -Value true

  # Make sure an HTTPs inbound rule is allowed
  New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" -Name "Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" -Profile Any -LocalPort 5986 -Protocol TCP

  # For security reasons, you might want to disable the firewall rule for HTTP that *Enable-PSRemoting* added:
  Disable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)"
  ```

  - `ip-address` or `fqdn-host-name` can be used for the `DnsName` property in the certificate creation. It should be the name that the actions runner will use to call to the IIS server.
  - `cert-name` can be any name.  This file will used to secure the traffic between the actions runner and the IIS server

## Example

```yml
...

jobs:
  stop-iis:
   runs-on: [self-hosted, windows-2019]
   env:
      server: 'iis-server.extendhealth.com'
      pool-name: 'website-pool'
      cert-path: './server-cert'

   steps:
    - name: Checkout
      id: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: IIS stop
      id: iis-stop
      uses: 'im-open/iis-service-action@v1.0.0'
      with:
        server: ${{ env.server }}
        service-account-id: ${{secrets.iis_admin_user}}
        service-account-password: ${{secrets.iis_admin_password}}
        app-pool-name: ${{ env.pool-name }}
        action: 'stop'
        server-public-key: ${{ env.cert-path }}

  ...
```
